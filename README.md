# EASY-DESIGN-PATTERM-EXAMPLES
I am trying to learn design pattern from internet, youtube, etc...And here are some examples.
Hope it will be interesting to you)))
Some useful links to learn:
+ Refactoring.Guru https://refactoring.guru/ (I love this page)(っ◔◡◔)っ ❤
+ SourceMaking https://sourcemaking.com/ (It's like a poorer version of the Refactoring.Guru, and has color "Aquamarine" interface ಠ益ಠ
